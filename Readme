# Chaotic Neural Network for Breast Cancer Classification
# Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **application of linear algebra, chaos theory, and deep learning** in medical data analysis.  
A **Chaotic Neural Network** is developed to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign or malignant** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset.

The project combines:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Chaotic Logistic Maps
- Neural Networks (PyTorch)


# Objectives
- Apply **PCA** for dimensionality reduction and visualization
- Understand the role of **eigenvalues and eigenvectors** in data analysis
- Implement a **chaotic logistic map** for neural network weight initialization
- Build and evaluate a **custom neural network** for classification

#Dataset
- **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**
- Features: 30 numerical features computed from digitized images
- Labels:
  - `0` → Malignant
  - `1` → Benign
